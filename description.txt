Have you ever wanted to get expert mode exclusive boss drops in normal mode? Well now you can, with Craftable Treasure Bags. This mod allows you to get expert mode items in normal mode, from crafting boss treasure bags and opening them right in normal mode!

This mod contains recipes for all vanilla boss treasure bags (Not including the Wall of Flesh and bosses/minibosses from the Old One's Army).
All treasure bags are to be crafted with an empty treasure bag at a Demon Altar, as well as certain items that can be used to make treasure bags (and modded ones). Make sure to also have the boss summoning item (some recipes may require other items instead of boss summoning items).
Craft an empty treasure bag with 10 silk at a loom.
Craft a boss treasure bag with boss loot and the respective boss summon item (some other recipes require different items as well besides boss loot only).
Some modded recipes do not use boss summon items to make the treasure bag.

This mod includes modded treasure bag recipes for the following mods:
- AlchemistNPC [i/s1:75]
- Ancients Awakened
- [c/0000FF:Azer][c/00C6FF:cad][c/00FFA6:mium]

[i/s1:75] = Overhauled most/all recipes and/or added a treasure item.

*Updates will be [c/DE2020:less frequent] due to real life complications.*

Q: "Why are there multiple modded treasure bag recipes popping up?"
A: I don't know how to utilize recipe groups for modded items. I only know how to utilize recipe groups with vanilla items.

EVENT: You can now craft a pre-hardmode treasure bag of your choice with the Celebratory Pendant, which appears upon character creation.

Version 0.15.1:
- Reworked all pendants except for the gold/platinum pendant, due to a fatal tModLoader bug that wiped out all of my game data and mod data.
	- I was able to recover the recipe code, but not the pendant codes. I was trying to redo the pendant codes as best as I could, hopefully matching them up with that they used to look like, and improving them.

Version 0.15:
- EVENT: You can now craft a pre-hardmode treasure bag of your choice with the Celebratory Pendant, which appears upon character creation. Thank you all for 50,000 Downloads!
	- You only have two chances, so choose wisely ;)
- Updated the title from Craftable Treasure Bags - Modded Bags Included to Craftable Treasure Bags. Everyone knows that it's not vanilla-restricted.
- All Vanilla bosses now require Gold/Platinum pendants.
- Added Bismite Pendant and Spirit Pendant, which can only be obtained if the Spirit Mod is Enabled.
- Changed all of the recipes for the Spirit Mod boss treasure bags. (Removing weapon loot to craft, adding herbs and other items to craft with, pendants as well, etc.)
